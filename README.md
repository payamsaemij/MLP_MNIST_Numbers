# MLP_MNIST_Numbers
It is one of the simplest and most famous neural network projects, which includes a dataset of images of numbers.
And the ultimate goal is to predict the images of numbers with the least error.
Such a simple project can be implemented with different algorithms, including MLP, CNN,...
And I tried to do this implementation with the MLP algorithm, the images of the results are available in the images section.
