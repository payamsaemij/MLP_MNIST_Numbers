# MLP_MNIST_Numbers
It is one of the simplest and most famous neural network projects, which includes a dataset of images of numbers.
And the ultimate goal is to predict the images of numbers with the least error.
Such a simple project can be implemented with different algorithms, including MLP, CNN,...
And I tried to do this implementation with the MLP algorithm, the images of the results are available in the images section.

The steps of learning and the amount of error in each step are as follows (minibatch-entropy):

The steps of learning and the amount of error in each step are as follows (epochs-entropy):

The final result displayed as a confusion_matrix :
